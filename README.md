# Discord-commands
Few discord commands I have created regarding crypto, stocks, and a few other random things. You must provide your own discord key and coinmarket cap api key in order for some commands to work. To view all the avalible commands, start up the discord bot and type '!guidee' or check out the last part of the code. Made it in one file so its simple to start up and have anyone copy and paste it. If any issues pop up, please let me know and i'll be happy and try to fix them. Have fun with it :)
